    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>History</h2>

<p>More than a year ago, we founded <a href="http://ZoomCaffe.com/">http://ZoomCaffe.com/</a> and have been providing excellent coffee throughout the Bay
Area since our first custom-designed truck rolled off the line.</p>

<p>This was actually a stealth-truck though: it looks like a coffee stand, but it is actually much more.  It is a mobile
powerhouse, and can function as:</p>

<ul>
<li> A high-end kitchen</li>
<li> A power-plant to almost any kind of event you imagine</li>
<li> An emergency water and heat vehicle</li>
<li> Car-camping extraordinaire</li>
<li> And the list goes on, just imagine a moving house and what it can enable.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Products</h2>

<p>We are now producing two major products:</p>

<ul>
<li> ZoomKitch – A water, gas, and power vehicle</li>
<li> ZoomBath – A water and shower vehicle</li>
</ul>


<p>Both are amazing, but we will start with the &lsquo;Kitchen&rsquo;</p>

<h3>ZoomKitch</h3>

<p>ZoomKitch is a mobile water and power plant that can also be configured with a world-class kitchen.  The core of the
product is our proprietary water and power system:</p>

<ul>
<li> Power

<ul>
<li>Both 240V and 120V AC power, along with 12V DC power</li>
<li>Powered by an incredibly <em>quiet</em> diesel generator and an optional solar system</li>
<li>Providing

<ul>
<li>10,000 watts of power with generator on, lasting for ??? hours on a full tank</li>
<li>2,800 watt AC/DC inverter</li>
<li>6000 usable watt hours from a fully charged solar system</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Water

<ul>
<li>??? gallons of clean water storage</li>
<li>Continuous water heater for unconstrained hot water</li>
<li>Water treatment of ??? gallons per hour into the clean storage tanks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Gas

<ul>
<li>Dual LP tanks with meters to identify which is operational and which is near empty</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>On top of this water and power plant, we provide commercial-caliber kitchen options:</p>

<ul>
<li> 15,000 BTU burners</li>
<li> ??? gallon refrigerator</li>
<li> ??? gallon freezer</li>
<li> Sink</li>
<li> Twelve feet wide counter</li>
<li> &hellip;</li>
</ul>


<h3>ZoomBath</h3>

<h2>Competitors / Choices</h2>

<p>We believe ZoomKitch is a huge step forward beyond anything being provided by others.  To really get even close to
a ZoomKitch kitchen, you would have to buy a huge Class-A motor home and live with 6MPG and the driving and parking
issues of the behemoth.  Other options include Roach-Coach kitchens, but these are much harder to keep clean and
don&rsquo;t provide anything close to our water and power system.  Finally, you could transport some of our features
as independent units, but you would lose functionality &amp; power and increase noise.</p>
